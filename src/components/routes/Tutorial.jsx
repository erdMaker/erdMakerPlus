        <h3 >Ternary relationships</h3>
        <p style={{textAlign:'left'}}>ðŸš© Look Here &amp; Look Across notations
       are  interpreted differently in ternary relationships in comparison to binary relationships.
       Ternary relationship in figure 3 is interpreted as: </p>
       <p>(i) In <i><b>Look Across</b></i> notation:</p>
       <p>â€¢	Each Employee, assigned to a Project, works at  one (1) Location.</p>
       <p>â€¢	Each Project, at a Location, is assigned to many (N) Employees.</p>
       <p>â€¢	Each Employee, at a Location, is assigned at  one (1) Project. </p>
      

       <p>(ii) In <i><b>Look Here</b></i> notation:</p>
       <p>â€¢	Each Project is assigned to one (1) Employee, at only one (1) Location.</p>
       <p>â€¢ Each Employee is assigned to many (N) Projects, in many (N) Locations.	</p>
       <p>â€¢ In each Location, one (1) Employee is assigned to one (1) Project.	 </p>

        <h4>Î¤ernary relationship to Binary  </h4>
        <p>ðŸš© Information Engineering, Bachman &amp; Barker notations allow only binary relationships. 
          If you have a ternary relationship in Crow's foot  (customized), you have to convert it into binary in order to proceed 
          to one of the three notations previously mentioned.</p>
